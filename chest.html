<strong>CHEST PAIN</strong>:</br>
A thorough description of the pain is an essential first step in the diagnosis of chest pain The patient with myocardial ischemia often vigorously denies feeling chest "pain."More typical descriptions include squeezing, tightness, pressure, constriction, strangling, burning, heart burn, fullness in the chest, a band-like sensation,not in the center of the chest, lump in the throat, ache, heavy weight on chest (elephant sitting on chest),like a bra too tight, and toothache (when there is radiation to the lower jaw).In some cases, the patient cannot qualify the nature of the discomfort, but places his or her fist in the center of the chest (the "Levine sign").
A "sharp" or "stabbing" pain with a pleuritic or positional component that is fully reproducible by palpation,in patients who have no history of angina or myocardial infarction, probably have low-risk for the episode being ischemic.
