<strong>COLD</strong>:</br>
Colds, sometimes called rhinovirus or coronavirus infections, are the most common illness to strike any part of the body.It is estimated that the average person has more than 50 colds during a lifetime.Anyone can get a cold, although pre-school and grade school children catch them more frequently than adolescents and adults.Repeated exposure to viruses causing colds creates partial immunity.
Although most more colds resolve on their own without complications, they are a leading cause of visits to the doctor and of time lost from work and school.Treating symptoms of the common cold has given rise to a multi-million dollar industry in over-the-counter medications.
