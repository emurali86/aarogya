<strong>CONSTIPATION(MOTION)</strong>:</br>
Constipation is an acute or chronic condition in which bowel movements occur less often than usual or consist of hard, dry stools that are painful or difficult to pass.Bowel habits vary,but an adult who has not had a bowel movement in three days or a child who has not had a bowel movement in four days is considered constipated.Constipation is one of the most common medical complaints in the United States.Constipation can occur at any age,and is more common among individuals who resist the urge to move their bowels at their body's signal.This often happens when children start school or enter day care and feel shy about asking permission to use the bathroom.
Constipation is more common in women than in men and is especially apt to occur during pregnancy.Age alone does not increase the frequency of constipation,but elderly people(especially women)are more likely to suffer from constipation.
