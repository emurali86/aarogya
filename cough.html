<strong>COUGH</strong>:</br>
While people can generally cough voluntarily, a true cough is usually a reflex triggered when an irritant stimulates one or more of the cough receptors found at different points in the respiratory system.These receptors then send a message to the cough center in the brain, which in turn tells the body to cough.A cough begins with a deep breath in, at which point the opening between the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx (glottis) shuts, trapping the air in the lungs.As the diaphragm and other muscles involved in breathing press against the lungs, the glottis suddenly opens, producing an explosive outflow of air at speeds greater than 100 miles (160 km) per hour.
In normal situations, most people cough once or twice an hour during the day to clear the airway of irritants.However, when the level of irritants in the air is high or when the respiratory system becomes infected, coughing may become frequent and prolonged.It may interfere with exercise or sleep,and it may also cause distress if accompanied by dizziness , chest pain , or breathlessness.In the majority of cases, frequent coughing lasts one to two weeks and tapers off as the irritant or infection subsides.If a cough lasts more than three weeks it is considered a chronic cough, and physicians try to determine a cause beyond an acute infection or irritant. </br>
