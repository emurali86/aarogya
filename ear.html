<strong>EAR PROBLEM</strong>: </br>
Ear infections are one of the most common reasons parents take their children to the doctor.The most common type of ear infection is called otitis media.It is caused by swelling and infection of the middle ear.The middle ear is located just behind the ear drum.
An acute ear infection starts over a short period and is painful.Ear infections that last a long time or come and go are called chronic ear infections.Ear infections are common in infants and children because the eustachian tubes are easily clogged.
Ear infections can also occur in adults, although they are less common than in children.</br>
