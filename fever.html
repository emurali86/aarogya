<strong>FEVER</strong>:</br>
A fever is the body's way of reacting to something abnormal in the body. Fevers, on their own, aren't bad for you unless they become too high or last too long though they can make you feel awful. The cause of the fever is the bigger concern. Fevers may help the body fight infections but that should not prevent a patient from trying to lower the temperature. Fevers can be caused by a number of conditions including: infections, reactions to medications, reactions to blood transfusions, cancer, or autoimmune diseases.
Symptoms of Fever:
Elevated temperature, weakness, chills, uncontrollable shivering (rigors), body aches, dizziness. 

Treatment includes: antipyretics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen), treatment of the underlying cause when found including antibiotics if a bacterial infection is suspected or confirmed. Infants should not receive aspirin as it could lead to a serious disease called Reyes syndrome. Hospital admission may be recommended if the patient is immunocompromised or seriously ill.
