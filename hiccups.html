<strong>HICCUPS</strong>:</br>
Hiccups are the result of an involuntary, spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm followed by the closing of the throat.</br>Hiccups are one of the most common, but thankfully mildest, disorders to which humans are prey.</br> Virtually everyone experiences them at some point, but they rarely last long or require a doctor's care.</br> Occasionally, a bout of hiccups will last longer than two days, earning it the name "persistent hiccups." Very few people will ex</br>perience intractable hiccups, in which hiccups last longer than one month.</br>A hiccup involves the coordinated action of the diaphragm and the muscles that close off the windpipe (trachea).</br> The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle separating the chest and abdomen, normally responsible for expanding the chest cavity for inhalation. </br>Sensation from the diaphragm travels to the spinal cord through the phrenic nerve and the vagus nerve, which pass through the chest cavity and the neck.</br> Within the spinal cord, nerve fibers from the brain monitor sensory information and adjust the outgoing messages that control contraction. </br>These messages travel along the phrenic nerve.</br>Irritation of any of the nerves involved in this loop can cause the diaphragm to undergo involuntary contraction, or spasm, pulling air into the lungs.</br> When this occurs, it triggers a reflex in the throat muscles.</br> Less than a tenth of a second afterward, the trachea is closed off, making the characteristic "hic" sound.</br>
