<strong>INJURIES</strong>:</br>
Injuries occur in two ways:Externally or Internally.</br>
An externally caused injury might involve someone bumping into you, impacting on your body to cause a fracture or dislocation.The external environment also brings risks,like dehydration in severe heat.</br>
Internally, sudden movements can tear and strain muscles, something that’s also possible from overuse.Chronic injuries arise when a condition is left untreated.The type of injury could be mild or severe, like an ‘open fracture’, when bones break and come out through the skin.</br>Ouch!
Causes of injury:</br>
Injuries in sport happen as a result of external force from outside your body orinternal force from inside your body.</br>
External Force</br>
There are two types:</br>
•Impact with someone (tackle, collision, punch, kick) or something (landing hard, running into a post).These cause bruises, sprains, fractures, dislocations or concussion.</br>
•The environment –very hot or cold conditions. Heat causes dehydration. Cold causes hypothermia.</br>
Common types of injury</br>
Fractures:</br>
•Closed - when the bone breaks but stays inside the skin.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Open - when the bone breaks and comes out through the skin.</br>
Joint injuries:</br>
•Dislocation - when the bones of a joint are wrenched apart.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Tennis and golf elbow - damage to tendons caused by overuse.</br>
•Cartilage - which tears in the knee and can 'lock' the joint</br>

Soft tissue injuries:</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Sprains - when ligaments are overstretched or torn around a joint, eg twisted or sprained ankle.</br>
•Strains - when a muscle or tendon is overstretched or torn, eg pulled muscle.</br>
•Bruises - caused when blood vessels burst under the skin following impact.</br>
Skin damage:</br>
•Cuts - caused by impact with a sharp object.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
•Grazes and blisters - caused by friction or rubbing.</br>
