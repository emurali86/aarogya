<strong>MOUTH ULCER</strong>:</br>Mouth ulcers are sores that appear in the mouth, often on the inside of the cheeks.</br>

Mouth ulcers, also known as aphthous ulcers, can be painful when eating, drinking or brushing teeth.</br>

Occasional mouth ulcers are usually harmless and clear up on their own. </br>Seek medical advice if they last longer than 3 weeks or keep coming back.</br>
Mouth ulcers cannot be caught from someone else.</br>
Up to 1 in 5 people get recurrent mouth ulcers.</br>
The main types of mouth ulcer are:</br>
•	Minor ulcers. These are around 2-8mm in diameter and usually clear up in 10 days to 2 weeks.</br>
•	Major ulcers. These are bigger and deeper, often with a raised or irregular border.</br> This type of ulcer can take several weeks to heal and may leave a scar in the mouth.</br>
•	Herpetiform ulcers: This type of ulcer is a cluster of dozens of smaller sores the size of pinheads.</br>
