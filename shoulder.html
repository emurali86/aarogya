<strong>Shoulder</strong>: </br>
Shoulder pain is any pain in or around the shoulder joint. </br>The shoulder is the most movable joint in the human body.</br> A group of 4 muscles and their tendons, called the rotator cuff, give the shoulder its wide range of motion.</br>
Swelling, damage, or bone changes around the rotator cuff can cause shoulder pain. </br>You may have pain when lifting the arm above your head or moving it forward or behind your back.</br>The most common cause of shoulder pain occurs when rotator cuff tendons become trapped under the bony area in the shoulder.</br> The tendons become inflamed or damaged.</br> This condition is called rotator cuff tendinitis or bursitis.</br> - See more at: http://umm.edu/health/medical/ency/articles/shoulder-pain#sthash.7B6MhB83.dpuf
