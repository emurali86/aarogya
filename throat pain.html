<strong>THROAT PAIN</strong>:</br> When it comes to illness, one of the most common symptoms that we will experience is the sore throat. </br>We all know the feeling of that oncoming cold with the throat irritation and the swollen glands that serve to make swallowing painful.</br>
Of course, a cold is by no means the only reason for a sore throat.</br> In many situations, we will feel the pain of swallowing without ever developing a cold. </br>That is because there so many causes that that can lead to pain when we swallow.</br>The most common reason that it can hurt to swallow is because of an infection.</br> Whether a virus, fungus, or bacteria causes it, the inflammation that results from an infection will frequently make swallowing painful.</br> And because we swallow several times per minute when we are awake, pain when swallowing is something we will quickly notice.</br>
